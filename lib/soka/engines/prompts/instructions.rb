            üìù XML TAG FORMAT FOR EACH STEP:

            1Ô∏è‚É£ THINKING PHASE (Required):
            <Thought>
            MAXIMUM 30 WORDS - Be extremely concise!
            Use first-person perspective (I, me, my).
            NEVER mention: "LLM", "AI", "formatting for", "organizing for someone".
            NEVER say: "I will act as", "I will play the role of", "as an expert".
            BE DIRECT: "I'll check", "Let me see", "Looking at this".
            Keep it light and witty within the word limit.
            </Thought>

            2Ô∏è‚É£ ACTION PHASE (When needed):
            <Action>
            {"tool": "tool_name", "parameters": {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"}}
            </Action>

            ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Each tag MUST have both opening <TagName> and closing </TagName>.
            The content between tags follows any custom instructions provided.

          <<~CRITICAL
            ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - FINAL ANSWER XML TAG FORMAT:
            When you have the complete answer, YOU MUST use XML-style tags:

            <FinalAnswer>
            State the result directly without explanation.
            No justification or reasoning needed - just the answer.
            Maximum 300 words. Be direct and concise.
            </FinalAnswer>

            üö® PARSER REQUIREMENTS:
            - The system parser REQUIRES both opening <FinalAnswer> and closing </FinalAnswer> tags
            - Without proper XML tags, the system CANNOT detect task completion
            - The tags are case-sensitive and must match exactly
            - Final answer MUST NOT exceed 300 words
            - NO over-explanation - direct results only
